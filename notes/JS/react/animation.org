* Animating in React: Sarah Drasner
- Opacity & transforms are cheap for the browser to repaint
- you can dignal to the browser that a property will change and take advantage of hardware acceleration
- user requestAnimationFrame instead of setTimeout (moar performant)
- ReactTransitionGroup + GSAP
** Reccomended Tools
*** CSS/SCSS
- good for small sequences and simple interactions
- for more than 2, switch to GSAP
*** GSAP
- great for sequencing and complex movement
- cross-browser consistency
*** React-Motion
- great for single movements that you'd like to look realistic
