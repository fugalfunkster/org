* Component Based Style Reuse : Pete Hunt
** What are the components?
** When do we decide a component's style attributes
** Class name conflicts
- caused by reliance on descendant selectors + nesting
- solve with
  1. No descendant selectors
  2. Unambiguous namespaces! (BEM/CSS Modules/etc.) Namespacing effectively isolates a component from its neighbots, but not from it's children.
  3. Component-based reuse, not class reuse. Don't use classes in JS.
- Inline Styles can accomplish the above! But, it has some drawbacks (media queries, performance, inheritance / css reset, accessibility?)
