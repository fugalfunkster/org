* Big Ideas

** First Class Functions

** by reference and by value

** scope, closures, and shadowing

** Principle of least privledge

** reassignment vs. mutation

** Function decorators

** Pure functions

** composition

** partial application

** execution context

** many forms of functions

** truthiness and logical operators

** control flow

** destructuring arrays and objects, spreading, and rest parameters

** big O

** linked lists

*** implementing with arrays

*** impl w/ obj

*** impl w/ funcs

** recursion

** flattening

** mapping

** folding

** TCO

** default arguments

** iterators
