Web Accessibility: Getting Started : Brian Treese (1:30)

* Planning for Accessibility
** Identify Goals
- Get on the same page
- Set a clear target
** Put Someone In Charge
- Everyone is responsible
- One Person Ensures Goals Are Met
** Evaluate Tools & Frameworks
** Research
- Best Practices
- New Tools
** Create Personas
- Keep accessibility in mind
- Common ground for discussion
- Create empathy
* Designing for Accessibility
** Responsive Design
** Color
*** don't rely solely on color
*** err on side of contrast, avoid subtle shades
** Typography
*** font-size (body 1em-1.25em)
*** contrast between head and body type
*** line-length (45-75 char)
*** line-height (1.25 of font-size)
*** don't justify test
** Form Design
*** Identify Required Fields
*** Identify Special Formatting Requirements
*** Clear form labels
*** don't rely on placeholder text, which dissapears
*** errors and warnings should be accompanied by text/icon not just color
** Touch Targets
*** small targets are more difficult to touch
*** min (44-48px)
*** put space between touch targets, to avoid*** 
** Focus and Active Indicators
*** text readers require browser focus/active behavior
*** Need to exist
*** Need to be unobstructed
*** Need Contrast
*** Do not remove with CSS or JS
*** Don't rely solely on color
** Motion & Vestibular Disorders
*** transforms / animation / parallax 
*** keep it simple, conserve motion
*** allow users to disable animations
** Designing for Crisis
*** create a diverse set of personas, and diverse contexts
*** provide information for different failure cases
* Coding for Accessibility 
** Proper Document Structure
*** headings
**** heading provide the document outline
**** dont skip around
*** HTML Lists
**** Use unordered lists when no order of sequence or important is needed
**** Use ordered lists
**** Use description Lists when items require descriptions
*** Keyboard Nav.
**** Have main content appear in code before sidebars, to facilitate keyboard nav.
** Images
*** Provide descriptions for any image providing informational content
**** alt 
an attribute that briefly conveys an images content
an empty value is ignored by screen readers
**** aria-describedby
an attribute that can be used to provide a link to extended description of an image's content
** Content
*** provide transcripts and captions for audio and video
*** provide descriptive links // ex: read more vs. read more about our products
** HTML Attributes
*** language attributes
*** img alt text
*** abbreviations need titles
*** forms (see below)
*** tabindex ensures that an element can be tabbed to
** Web Forms
*** groud logical fields together in a field set
*** use legends
*** label input and for attribute
*** don't rely on placeholder text
*** tab order
** Accessible Keyboard Control
*** focus and active indicators, don't remove this (display: none)
*** use focus
*** the structure of markup determines tab order
*** avoid non-navigable items (created w/ js events) with tabindex=0
*** 'skip navigation' link to main content
** CSS & Accessibility
*** End user settings override browser and developer CSS styles
*** use relative units like ems and rems
*** use proper semantic markup, don't rely on 
*** enhance active and focus styling
** Performance
*** keep file sizes small
*** limit http requests
*** optimize images (jpeg mini, tiny png)
*** image sprites
*** use SVG
*** critical CSS (by addi osmani)
** Progressive Enhancement
* WATCHEDONLY ARIA Roles & Attributes
* WATCHEDONLY Accesssibility Guidelines and Standards
* Accesssibility Testing, Tools, & Resources
** Testing for Accessibility
*** try to navigate the page without a mouse
*** use a screenreader (JAWS)
*** mac's have a voiceover feature builtin
*** WCAG checklist from WC3
** Accessibility Tools
*** WAVE evaluation tool
*** colour contrast analyzer
*** accessibility dev tools chrome extension
*** tenon.io integrates accessibility testing into development process
*** no replacement for human testing
** Accessibility Resources
*** WebAIM.org
*** The Accessibility Project (a11yproject.com)
*** the accessibility cheatsheet
*** kahn academy tota11y tester
*** accessibility wins (a11ywins.tumblr.com)
*** Periodic table of ARIA roles / ARIA attributes
