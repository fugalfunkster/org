Responsive Web Images

* What are responsive web images?
** What is responsive web design?
1. Fluid Grid
2. Media Queries (CSS3)
3. Flexible Images
** Images make up 63% of webpage size! Most pages are > 2 Mbs!
** We want to deliver the most appropriate/performant image for the design and device.
** Mediaqueries let the site know how large the viewport is
*** arc direction images let you crop images for different sized displays
* Image Types
** Raster v. Vector

|-----------------------------------------+----------------------------|
| Raster (don't scale well)               | Vector                     |
|-----------------------------------------+----------------------------|
| Rectangular grid of single color pixels | Mathematical equations     |
| specific width and height               | zoom or scale without loss |
| Photos                                  | Logos or Icons             |
| JPEG, GIF, PNG, WEBP                    | SVG                        |

** JPEG (Best for Photos)
*** uses lossy compression: trades off quality vs. file size
**** 
*** progressive JPEG
**** appear fuzzy at first, then gradually increase in quality
**** remember the early web, modems
** GIF (animations)
*** 8 bit / 256 colors
*** lossless compression
*** used for animation (otherwise not performant)
** PNG (transparency)
*** 8 - 32 bits per pixel
*** Lossless or lossy compression (not as strong of JPEG)
*** transparency!
** WEBP (low browser support, like gif and png)
*** animation and transparency
*** potential size advantages
*** limited browser support
** SVG (best for responsive design!)
*** XML Vector image format
*** points, lines, shapes
*** resolution independent
** icons, fonts, and gradients
*** Icon fonts (vector based replacement for raster icons)
**** fontawesome has good examples
*** Web Fonts (vector based replacement for raster fonts)
*** CSS3 gradients (traditionally done as background images)
* Responsive Image Use Cases
** Resolution Based Selection (most common use case)
*** We want to deliver the same image to devices with different resolutions
*** Low Resolution devices avoid wasting bandwith, time, memory
** Art Direction
** Pixel Ratio Based Selection
** Image Types
