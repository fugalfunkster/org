Responsive Web Design : Ben Callahan (4:31)

* Intro
* RWD 101
** A Fluid Foundation
Use proportionate Thinking! Move away from pixels and to relative units of measure. Honor the proportions of
the design by creating percentage-based grids instead of fixed-width, pixel-based grids.
** IE Rounding
Older versions of IE round up.
** Semantic Grid Systems
http://semantic.gs
http://susy.oddbird.net
** Flexible Content
Content inside the layout must also be flexible.
*** responsive images
Use a max-width, or width, proportionate to the parent container. Width alone will permit the image to scale
beyond its original size... Max-width 100%, prevents the image from overflowing its parent, and from scaling beyond its size.

#+BEGIN_SRC css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
}
#+END_SRC

*** videos
**** video container that will maintain an aspect ratio of 2:1
#+BEGIN_SRC css

.video_container {
  position: relative;
  height: 0;
  padding:bottom: 50%
}

#+END_SRC

** Media Queries
Make large layout adjustments when necessary.
*** Media Types
We usually just use all, screen, or print. All is the default.
| all | braille | embossed | speech | handheld | print | projection | screen | tv | tty |

*** Media Features
Generally, features appear as name: value pairs. We predominately use width, and sometimes orientation.
| width | height      | devide-width | orientation | aspect-ratio | device-aspect-ratio |
| color | color-index | monochrome   | resolution  | scan         | grid                |
Width is viewport width. Device width is the width of the viewport in its standard orientation, ex the
device-width of an iPhone is 320px, even though it may be in landscape mode...

*** Two approaches to writing queries

|-------------------------------+----------------------------------------|
| large first                   | small first                            |
|-------------------------------+----------------------------------------|
| Easy support for old IE       | more logical (build up, not tear down) |
| small devices load all assets | old IE is tricky                       |
| more work for the device      |                                        |
|-------------------------------+----------------------------------------|

**** Large Resolution First

#+BEGIN_SRC css

/* large resolution layouts here */

  @media (max-width: 62em) {
    /* styles for 62em and down go here */
  }

  @media (max-width: 40em) {
    /* styles for 40em and down go here */
  }

#+END_SRC

**** Small Resolution First

#+BEGIN_SRC css

/* smallest resolution layouts here */

  @media (max-width: 28em) {
    /* styles for 28em and down go here */
  }

  @media (max-width: 53em) {
    /* styles for 53em and down go here */
  }

#+END_SRC

*** Media Query Code Examples
**** Head of HTML

#+BEGIN_SRC css

  /* stylesheet applies when the min-width is 30ems */
  <link media="(min-width: 30em)" ...

  /* stylesheet applies when the device is screen and the min-width is 30ems */
  <link media="screen and (min-width: 30em)" ...

#+END_SRC

**** In Stylesheet

#+BEGIN_SRC css

  @media (min-width: 30em ) {...}

  @media screen and (min-width: 30em) {...}

#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC css

  @media (min-width: 600px) {
    /* styles for 600px and up go here */
  }

  @media (max-width: 38em) {
    /* styles for 38em and down go here */
  }

#+END_SRC

** Other RWD Considerations
*** Touch Target Areas
**** Apple recommends minimum 44px x 44px (based on non-retina displays)
**** Use padding instead of margin
*** Hover States
**** Don't hide content behind :hover (often happens in nav drop downs)
**** Consider using modernizr to hide hover states behind a .no-touch class

#+BEGIN_SRC css

a {
  /* standard styles */
}

.no-touch a:hover {
  /* :hover styles */
}

#+END_SRC

*** Contrast
**** Try your site outside in the sun
**** Try your site in bed when its dark
**** Take it with you
*** Readability
**** Small screen != small type
**** Consider increasing font-size
* RWD Process
** A Myth About Process
"Each client deliverable needs to look more liks a final, beautiful end-product than the previous one."
Which results in pushing toward nearly-designed wireframes quickly, and completely designed comps soon
after. A better mindset focuses on deliverables that best serve the organization and prioritization of content and function across multiple resolutions.
*** Deliverables
**** Research Deliverables
- Brand analysis
- Competitor analysis
- Requirements gathering
- Investigate current site (what works, what doesn't)
- Stakeholder interviews
**** Content Deliverables
- Content inventory
- Gap analysis
**** Priority Deliverables
- Information Architectures
- Wireframes
**** Style Deliverables
- Layout
- Typography
- Color
- Texture
**** Functional Deliverables
- Templates
- CMS system / Datable integration
- Custom integration
** Content Priority Prototype (ideal for content based pages, not apps)
Takes the place of a traditional wireframe. Includes real content, as much as possible. Order the content,
the prototype should be linear in nature, so priority is implied. Always create it in HTML, so it must be 
viewed in a browser, but don't be concerned with style. It's about the content, start by marking up the 
content, worry about how it will look later. NO LAYOUT.
** Style Prototype
Like style tiles, but in the browser (instead of photoshop). Very fast to build, can even be generated from a 
template. We're just getting concepts down for colors, textures, typography, and maybe links, etc. Easy to 
show web interaction. Client reqiews in their browser of preference, so expectations are set regarding what 
it will look like when they view their website in the future.

** !Priority
Priority becomes critical wqith smaller displays

* Applying RWD Styles
** The Basic Structure

#+BEGIN_SRC html

<head>

  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <!-- necessary to get apple devices to report actual viewport size  -->

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="c/base.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" media="not print" href="c/mq.css">
  <!-- load base css styles, then load media query styles if not print -->

  <!--  use Sass to run some logic on media features.
        in this case, we're inserting a css file for
        browsers that don't support media queries
        [if (lte IE 8 )&)!IEMobile)]>
    <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="c/nomq.css">
  <![endif]-->

</head>

#+END_SRC

** CSS Files (using Sass)
You can use Sass to build up css styles from separate files.
In the previous example, base.css might import a reset or normalize, then include the smallest width 
stylesheet. The mq.css imports an additional stylesheet based on media queries. nomq.css imports the same 
thing as mq.css but without media queries. This is an additive approach, relying on latter styles to
override previous ones.
  Note that without Sass, you might require the client download multiple styles, based on media queries. Sass 
is just helping reduce the number of files loaded. 
 
*** Ex sans Sass:

#+BEGIN_SRC html

<link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheets/reset.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheets/smallest.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheets/450.css" media="(min-width: 450px)">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheets/600.css" media="(min-width: 600px)">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheets/950.css" media="(min-width: 950px)">

** Implementing RWD Styles
http://mediaqueri.es/
** Using EM-Based Media Queries
Ems are relative, based on the initial font size declaration. Layouts adjust based on font-size. This
better adheres to the principles of RWD.
** RWD Patterns: Navigation
*** flavors
**** top nav
**** bottom nav (footer nav)
**** slide down nav
**** select box nav
**** menu icon nav
**** multi-level (tiered)
