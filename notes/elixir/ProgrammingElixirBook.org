* DONE Modules and Named Functions
Named functions can only exist inside modules. Internally, named functions are identified by both name and arity. Thus, you could have two functions in the same module, with the same name, but with different arity. Check out the code block below and corresponding file for function forms.
** Compiling a Module
Modules are compiled: either give IEx a source file's name or use the =c= helper

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ iex ./e/times.esx
#+END_SRC

or

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
# c "./e/times.esx" # the c helper, in org-mode it only needs to be loaded once
# Times.double(5.5)
  Times.double(2,2) # multi-arity experiment
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 8

** The Function Body - Block Syntax

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
c "./e/times.esx"
# Times.double("string")
# Times.triple(2)
# Times.quadruple(2)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 8

** Function Calls and Pattern Matching
Like anonymous functions, the passed arguments are matched to the functions parameter list.
Each function can have multiple clauses - a function body that matches a parameter list.
We can have multiple clauses the same definition - in one module 

in the order (first to last) that they must be matched
and the arity's gotta be consistent,
adjacency is nice

Let's use pattern matching, and multiple function clauses to implement a recursive function that calculates its argument's factorial

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  # c "./e/mathy.esx"
  Mathy.factorialOf(10)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 3628800

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  # c "./e/mathy.esx"
  # Mathy.sum(10)
  # Mathy.gcd(7,31)
  Mathy.gcd(6,36)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 6

** Guard Clauses
Guard clauses are predicates used to match function definitons. Guard classes are matched after any paramater-based matching.

They use introduce the =when= keyword, which preceeds the predicate.

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
# c "./e/guard.esx"

# Guard.what_is(:bin)

Guard.factorialOf(-1) # not defined for this input

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ** (FunctionClauseError) no function clause matching in Guard.factorialOf/1
:     e/guard.esx:12: Guard.factorialOf(-1)

*** Operators, type-check functions, etc.
https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/case-cond-and-if.html#expressions-in-guard-clauses
**** Comparison Operators
== != === !== > < <= >=
**** Boolean and negation (sans || &&)
or and not ! 
**** Join operators
<> ++
**** in operator
**** Type-check functions
usually looks like : is_<type>

** Default Parameters
You can give a default value to any parameter using =\\=. Parameters without a default value are "required parameters." When a function with default values is called, the call will fail if the number of arguments is less than the number of required parameters. If the function is called with fewer arguments than the number of paramters, default parameters will supplement the arguments to meet arity, from right to left. Then, the arguments will match the parameters from left to right, as usual. 

When you have multiple function clauses, the relationship between arity, requried paramaters, and defaults can conflict. So, there are some rules to follow:
1. When one clause has the same arity as another clause's required parameters, one would shadow the other. So, if the clause with the default params is first, it will throw a compile error that the functions are in conflict. If the clause with the default params appears later, the compiler will issue a warning, that the clause is shadowed by a prior clause w/ respect to arity.

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
c "./e/arity.esx"
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [33mwarning: [0mthis clause cannot match because a previous clause at line 2 always matches
:   e/arity.esx:5
: 
: [DefaultParams]

2. When you have multiple function clauses, with the same arity, and one of them has default values, write the default parameters in a function head with no body. These defaults will apply to all calls to the function.

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
c "./e/arity.esx"
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [33mwarning: [0mredefining module DefaultParams (current version loaded from Elixir.DefaultParams.beam)
:   e/arity.esx:1
: 
: [33mwarning: [0mvariable p1 is unused
:   e/arity.esx:11
: 
: [DefaultParams]


EXERCISE: 

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  # c "./e/guess.esx"

 Chop.guess(7, 1..10)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Is it 5
: Is it 8
: Is it 6
: Is it 7
: The answer is 7
: :ok

** Private Functions
Use the =defp= macro. Note, functions with multiple heads must all be private. 

** The Amazing Pipe Operator: |>
The =|>= operator passes the result of the expressions on its left as the first argument to the function to its right.

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
# not execuable
list
|> salesTax(2018) # note that 2018 becomes the second param on invocation
|> prepare_filing
#+END_SRC

** Modules
Modules provide namespacing for funcitons, macros, structs, protocols, and other modules. When you nest modules in your code, the namespace is the concatenation of the names, with =.=. But, also note, all modules are defined "at the top level." So a module named "Tasks" inside a module named "Mix" would be named =Mix.Tasks=, but would have no other relationship to functions that are simply in the =Mix= module. This is illustrated by the ability to name modules with =.=s directly.

*** The =import= Directive
=import= let's you brink a module's functions/macros into the current scope. 

full syntax: =import Module [, only:|except:]=

The optional =only:= and =except:= parameters accept a keyword list of name: arity pairs.

*** The =alias= Directive
Helps cut down on typing!

=alias My.Other.Module.Parser= puts =Parser= in scope. 
The optional parameter =as:= can be used to ref the module with a different name.
We can also grab multople modules at a time:
=alias My.Other.Module.{Parser, Runner}=

*** The =require= Directive
Necessary for macros

** Module Attributes
Module attributes are metadata, assigned using =@=. You can access attributes in functions, but must declare, and set! them in the top level of a module. You can set the same attribute multiple times in a module, and the lookup behaves lexically, like other vars.

** Module Names
In Elixir, module names should be capatalized. When Elixir encouters a name starting with an uppercase letter, the name is converted to an atom of the same name with =Elixir= prepended. In a way, Elixir is basically a module within Erlang. A call to =IO.puts= is a call to =Elixir.IO.puts=.
** Calling a Function in an Erlang Library
Erlang vars start with an uppercase, and atoms are lowercase (no colon) - in Elixir modules are uppercased, vars begin lowercased, and atoms are preceded by a colon. To reference an erlang atom, just put a colon in from of it.

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
:io.format("the number is ~3.1f~n", [5.678])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: the number is 5.7
: :ok

** Finding Libraries

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  # :io.format("~4.2f~n", [3.8746])
  # System.user_home()
  # Path.extname("./e/arity.esx")
  # System.cwd()
  # System.cmd("node", ["-v"])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: {"v6.3.1\n", 0}
