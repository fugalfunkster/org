* Responsive Typography: An Introduction
** Intro
*** files for course: http://github.com/jpamental/workshop-rt
** Art and Technology
*** Our canvas is fluid, we can't be sure how our content will be viewed.
** A Make-Believe Place
*** We can't make assumptions about context of use
**** screen size
**** device capabilities
**** user's concurrent activities
**** depth of user's focus
**** users purpose for visiting the site
*** Type conveys meaning and importance, anyone can recognize the new yorker from Type
*** Four Steps
1. PErformance: select fonts with care, load what you need and don't block the page draw
2. Progressive: plan for failure, tunr up the loading process & fallback fonts to minimize 
   FOUT
3. Proportion: small screens demans subtle scale
4. Polish: Design is the details: OpenType & then some...
** Performance
*** Load only what you need
**** don't load all weights, styles, and variants for every font you want to use
*** FOUT: Flash of unstyled text
**** web font loader lets us style our content with css hooks for whether web fonts have loaded 
**** .wf-inactive / .wf-active
**** this css results in a blank screen during load
#+BEGIN_SRC css
body {
  font-family: "Trade Gothic", helvetica, arial;
}
#+END_SRC
**** This shows content straight away
#+BEGIN_SRC css
.wf-inactive body {
  font-family: helvetica, arial;
}
#+END_SRC
**** adjust font-size, line-height, and letter spacing to avoid render jumps when fonts load
** Progressive Enhancement
*** movement is distracting, text styling is not
** Proportion
*** Modern scale:
**** http://bit.ly/jprwt
*** dont' change body size, scale around it
*** use ems, they work everywhere
*** Measure and Sale
**** Use max-width on elements to keep text readable.
*** Dont' use loren ipsum
** Polish
*** don't forget fit and finish
*** enable OpenType enabled fonts
*** adding multi-colums to break up monotony
*** Use media queries to keep things in proportion
*** dont' leave orphans behind (single words on the last line of a p) typogrify!
