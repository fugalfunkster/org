* Responsive Typography: An Introduction
** Intro
*** files for course: http://github.com/jpamental/workshop-rt
** Art and Technology
*** Our canvas is fluid, we can't be sure how our content will be viewed.
** A Make-Believe Place
*** We can't make assumptions about context of use
**** screen size
**** device capabilities
**** user's concurrent activities
**** depth of user's focus
**** users purpose for visiting the site
*** Type conveys meaning and importance, anyone can recognize the new yorker from Type
*** Four Steps
1. Performance: select fonts with care, load what you need and don't block the page draw
2. Progressive: plan for failure, tunr up the loading process & fallback fonts to minimize 
   FOUT
3. Proportion: small screens demans subtle scale
4. Polish: Design is the details: OpenType & then some...
** Performance
*** Load only what you need
**** don't load all weights, styles, and variants for every font you want to use
*** FOUT: Flash of unstyled text
**** web font loader lets us style our content with css hooks for whether web fonts have loaded 
**** .wf-inactive / .wf-active
**** this css results in a blank screen during load
#+BEGIN_SRC css
body {
  font-family: "Trade Gothic", helvetica, arial;
}
#+END_SRC
**** This shows content straight away
#+BEGIN_SRC css
.wf-inactive body {
  font-family: helvetica, arial;
}
#+END_SRC
**** adjust font-size, line-height, and letter spacing to avoid render jumps when fonts load
** Progressive Enhancement
*** movement is distracting, text styling is not
** Proportion
*** Modern scale:
**** http://bit.ly/jprwt
*** dont' change body size, scale around it
*** use ems, they work everywhere
*** Measure and Sale
**** Use max-width on elements to keep text readable.
*** Dont' use loren ipsum
** Polish
*** don't forget fit and finish
*** enable OpenType enabled fonts
*** adding multi-colums to break up monotony
*** Use media queries to keep things in proportion
*** dont' leave orphans behind (single words on the last line of a p) typogrify!
** Responsive Web Typography Review
*** Adapt to screen size, network speed, & device capabilities
* Typography Basics: Anatomy, Picking, and Pairing
** What is Typography
- Be conscious of your client and project's context
- Enhance your design and amplify its message, meaning, and intent
- Use or break conventions intentionally
** Type Anatomy
*** styles and classifications

|-------------|
| serif       |
| sans-serif  |
| slab-serif  |
| monospaced  |
| display     |
| script      |
| blackletter |
| handwriting |

*** thick and thin
*** oval or round
*** size determines whether thin lines render elegantly
** Type Selection
*** Tone (Formal vs. Informatl)
*** History - time (period)
*** origin/ethnic relationship
*** Intended Use
*** explote font outlets, see links below
*** "type is the clothes words wear"
** Type Pairing
*** matching qualities
**** oval vs. round
**** wide vs tall
**** think vs. thin
*** Family - by Designer
*** related history (time/place)
** Know what translates
*** Type selection and pairing
*** much can be done with CSS
*** OpenType Features bring more finesse w/ easy fallback
*** Many techniques translate, but often only in spirit
** And what doesn't
*** rendering differs from browser to browser (use typecast)
*** content changes 
*** viewport changes (stay relative)
*** 
* Performance & Progressive Enhancement: Getting it On-screen, Fast
** Don't Block Page Render
*** Mobile first!
- simple, one column layout
- mediaqueries add as page loads
- noting loads unless it is needed for a particular layout
*** fonts and javascript are separate dependencies in browsers
*** don't let loading block the render or text
*** 75% of mobile users in 5 seconds
*** have fallback content in place and load enhancements afterward
** Performance is Design
*** use asunc loading
*** leverage web font loader to fix the unstyled part
*** FOUT: Flash of unstyled text
**** web font loader lets us style our content with css hooks for whether web fonts have loaded 
**** .wf-inactive / .wf-active
**** this css results in a blank screen during load
#+BEGIN_SRC css
body {
  font-family: "Trade Gothic", helvetica, arial;
}
#+END_SRC
**** This shows content straight away
#+BEGIN_SRC css
.wf-inactive body {
  font-family: helvetica, arial;
}
#+END_SRC
**** adjust font-size, line-height, and letter spacing to avoid render jumps when fonts load
*** Progressively Enhance
**** support for @font-face is more likely than JS
**** tune for loading process
**** include <noscript> as fallback
* Proportion: One Size Won't Rule Them All
* Polish: Sweating the Small Stuff
* A Perfect Page
